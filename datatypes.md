# Different Types of Data

## CS Types of Data
We've talked about different types of data before when thinking about writing code. Let's review what *type* means in the context of computer science.

1. What are some different types of data you've worked with? _Hint: what's a class?_

We've worked with ints floats strings and booleans.

3. What happens if you try to average a list of strings?

You get an error saying that you can't do math to strings.

5. Why is a variable's type important?

It determines in what ways it can be used and what functions can apply to it.

## Statistical Types of Data
In statistics, a variable's type means something different compared to what we've seen in computer science.

1. What is a statistical variable, and how is it different from a computer science variable?
2. Why is a statistical variable's type important?

### Vocabulary
I encourage you to search online for these answers! Try to respond in your own words.
1. What is the difference between a **quantitative** and a **qualitative** variable?

A quantitative variable has a number associated with it and a qualitative variable is a word description.

3. What is the difference between a **discrete** and a **continuous** variable? Are these quantitative or qualitative?



5. What is the difference between a **nominal** and an **ordinal** variable? Are these quantitative or qualitative?
6. What is a qualitative variable that's not **categorical**?

### Application
1. A researcher is studying childrenâ€™s favorite colors. They label each color with a number -- for example, they record red as 1, blue as 2, green as 3, and so on. Later on, when they are analyzing their data, they find that the average favorite color is 2.78, and conclude that children like the color blue-green. Discuss the issues that led to this erroneous conclusion.

The researcher is bad because their data is not ordinal so the numbers do not matter in effect. This means that taking the average is meaningless because children that like red do not necessarily like blue the same as children who like green.

2. A researcher is studying student burnout. What questions might they want to ask, and what data would they record? What are possible analyses of this data, and how do those analyses depend on the data types?

They might want to ask if a student feels burnt out which they would get a yes or no response to. They also might ask the source of the burnout and ways to fix it. These would non categorical data.
