**Having Fun with Digimon**

  This lab was a fun one. For it we were given a csv file with 3 questions to write functions to solve. Whenever I have a coding project that is not immediately 
obvious I always try to go in stages. First I try to get some code down that works. That means writing the first thing that comes to my head and weeding out the 
bugs so that it does what I want it to do. Note that what I want it to do is not always what the coding project is supposed to do. The logic of the code might be 
flawed or miss edge cases, but if it is doing what the logic I was thinking did, the step is over. Then I find the all the problems that impede functionality. This 
may be the missed cases or the program taking way too long to run. Finally I optimize and clarify the code. I try to condense code if I can while adding more clear 
variable names and making sure that my code is easier to read.
 
  The objectives for this lab are to find the average speed of the digimon in the dataset and create functions that return the amount of Digimon with a certain 
value for a given column and a team of 3 digimon that have combined less than 15 memory and greater than or equal to 300 attack. The first objective I made as a 
function and it was pretty simple. The function looped through the csv and added up the speed values of the digimon and kept track of the number of digimon. After 
it was done looping, it returned the total speed divided by the average speed. In sudo code it looks like this:
~~~
function:
  open connection with file:
    number of digimon = 0
    total speed = 0
    for every row in file:
      add 1 to number of digimon
      add this digimon's speed to the total speed
    return total speed divided by number of digimon
~~~
For the next function I created I looped through the dataset and if the conditions matched the input conditions add 1 tot he number of digimon. In sudo code:
~~~
function with parameters of column and value for column:
  open connection with file:
    number of digimon with parameters as a trait = 0
    for every row in file
      if digimon was the value for the specified column:
        add 1 to number of digimon 
    return number of digimon
~~~
For the final function I created a triple nested for loop so that every possible permutation of 3 digimon is checked against the condition, less than 15 total memory and greater than or equal to 300 attack. This means every combination is checked so I guarantee have a solution if one exists. In sudo code:
~~~
function:
 open connection to file:
  for every digimon in file:
    for every digimon in file:
      for every digimon in file:
        if the 3 digimon have less than 15 total memory and greater than or equal to 300 attack:
          return the 3 digimon
~~~

  Then it was time to fix all of the errors. The first 2 functions were fine, but the last one ended up taking over 15 seconds to run. This means that this was wildly inefficient and so needed immediate fixing. The solution I came up with was to first loop through the dataset
