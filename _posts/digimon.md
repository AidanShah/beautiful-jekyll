  This lab was a fun one. For it we were given a csv file with 3 questions to write functions to solve. Whenever I have a coding project that is not immediately 
obvious I always try to go in stages. First I try to get some code down that works. That means writing the first thing that comes to my head and weeding out the 
bugs so that it does what I want it to do. Note that what I want it to do is not always what the coding project is supposed to do. The logic of the code might be 
flawed or miss edge cases, but if it is doing what the logic I was thinking did, the step is over. Then I find the all the problems that impede functionality. This 
may be the missed cases or the program taking way too long to run. Finally I optimize and clarify the code. I try to condense code if I can while adding more clear 
variable names and making sure that my code is easier to read.
  
  The objectives for this lab are to find the average speed of the digimon
