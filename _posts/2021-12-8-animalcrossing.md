**Achieving Socks**

  In this post I will tell you how I achieved sock. This lab was about pulling data from an Animal Crossing API and using it to answer a couple of questions.
The data was collected by a bunch of people on the internet.
  
  The first task was to use the API to generate a csv that we could then analyze.
