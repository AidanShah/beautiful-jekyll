**Research Meta Analysis: "Improving election prediction internationally"**

In this post I will be doing a meta analysis of the study "Improving election prediction internationally". Starting out with what's in the study, its goal is to 
create a model that can accurately direct elections of executive figures around the globe. The null hypothesis is that the factors that the study tests can not be 
used to predict election outcomes, and the alternative hypothesis is that these factors can be used to predict election outcomes. They considered many factors so 
I'm not going to list them all, but the general categories that these factors come from are incumbency, polling, the economy, democracy, and foreign relations. They 
evidence their end conclusions with a variety of graphs and statistical measures of correlation, and also test their model on elections not in their dataset. 
Interestingly to me was that they do not mention p values anywhere in the study.


Now let's get into the background of the study. It was authored by Ryan Kennedy, Stefan Wojcik, and David Lazer. Kennedy and Lazer are both professors of political 
science, and Wojcik is a data scientist at twitter. The institution that ties these people to together is the Lazer Lab. The Lazer Lab is an institution started by 
David Lazer that does politics related projects. Note: Lazer is a very cool last name and I appreciate that David Lazer named his organization Lazer Lab despite it 
not having anything to do with lasers. Despite its name it isn't a particularly dramatic institution and is likely not a front for a government trying to influence 
elections. This study is part of a project that has been running since 2012 and continues to run. The only odd thing I found was that Wojcik was listed as an author 
of the study but not a researcher on the project. I first thought this was because he left the project, but it seems that Kennedy also left the project which left 
me confused. This specific study was funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). Its a government funding group that gives money to 
research about AI, machine learning, quantum computing, and synthetic biology. Given that election prediction doesn't fall under any of those categories, I am less 
sure of the previous statement that Lazer Lab is not a front for the US government. The funding source and people doing the research don't seem to have any alterior 
motives that would incentivize manipulating results. This specific study came out early 2017 after the unexpected election of Donald Trump. After that, the accuracy 
of pollsters became a hot topic. The study also mentions this election more than once making it seem like this may have been the reason for the publication date 
especially since the project is still ongoing. This also indicates that the study was subject to publihs or perish. They may have published at this time to create 
more publicity and get more funding.


Finally let's discuss their data. Their dataset is public, but it is not explicitly clear where to find it. The study did have a supplementary materials section 
where I expected to find it, but it wasn't there. Instead within a pdf in the supplementary materials section, there is a link that takes you to the dataset. On the 
data selection side I think they were quite thorough. Obviously they could have picked more economic factors or other random variables, but I think the ones they 
chose were quite good. I mainly looked at which countries they were using because I thought it would be likely that they just picked Western European countries and 
the US, but to my surprise there were a large range of countries. At first I spotted regions were there were none or few countries, North African and East and South 
Asia, but this is likely because these countries do not have direct executive elections. For example, India uses a parlimentary system so is not included in this 
study. Overall, the data was fairly good.
