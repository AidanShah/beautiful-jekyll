1. In the following snippet of code, label the name of the variable and the name of the class. Use this example to explain what an object is in the context of memory.
    ```py
    p1 = Point(2,3)
    ```
 
 The variable is p1 and the Point is class. P1 is a object of type Point similar to how 9 is an object of type class. This means that p1 does not stroe the fields of the object, 2 and 3, as individual integers but rather stores it as a Point object.
  
2. A researcher is conducting a survey on favorite sports and encodes each sport with a number. For example, 1=Archery, 2=Boxing, 3=Curling, and so on. They average these numbers to get 2.3 and conclude that on average, people's favorite sport is boxing on ice. Why is this incorrect?

This is because the sports are neither ordinal nor quantitative. The average of 2.3 doesn't mean anything because the numbers in this case are representative of sports rather than actual numbers and you can't do operations on sports because that wouldn't mean anything. 

4. A researcher is conducting a study on vegetarian diets. They stand in front of a build-your-own-salad restaurant and survey people who enter. Identify the population, and explain why this is not a great sample.

The population is all people on vegetarian diets. This is not a great sample because the sampling method, collecting data outside then salad place, biases the data toward vegetarians who like to eat salads rather than any other diet because those will be the people the researcher more often encounters. 

6. A researcher wants to study the population of all New York City residents. What is a feasible sample frame, and what biases might this sample frame be prone to?

The researcher could have many people stand in different neighborhoods and interview the people that pass by. Because of the diverse range of activity that New Yorkers are engaged in it may be difficult to get a sample frame that will encompass all people. This sample frame may exclude people that do not walk around much and do not engage with random people on the street. Depending on where the person stands in the neighborhood there may be even more bias. For example, if they stood in front of a gym they will likely get a younger sample.

8. A scientist conducted an observational study on mental health and calculated that the correlation between recreational drug use and depression is 0.83. Why can't they conclude that recreational drug use causes depression?

This is because observational studies can not determine causation, only correlation. This is because the researchers are not able to completely control the independent variable. This can cause problems like opposite way causation and possibly a third variable causing both of the effects. This may be a good indication that an experimental study should be conducted so that causation, or lack thereof, can be evidenced.
