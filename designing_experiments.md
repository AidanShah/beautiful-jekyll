# Designing Experiments

## Review
1. What is the difference between **independent** and **dependent** variables?

Independent variable is what the researcher controls or the input variable. The dependent variable is the response variable that the research measures.

3. What is the difference between a **null** and **alternative** hypothesis?

The null hypothesis is the idea that there is no correlation. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a correlation.

5. How/why can experimental studies show causation?

This is because they can create 2 identical situations save for one thing so that it is the only thing affecting the outcome.

7. How might sampling bias affect the results of an experiment?

You might only pick subjects that produce a certain result in the experiment.

## Designing an Experiment
1. Put these steps in the correct order:
     - Ask a precise question 4
     - Identify independent and dependent variables 2
     - Identify sample frame 8
     - Obtain sample to include in experiment 9
     - Identify population 3
     - Do background research 1
     - Conduct treatments on **control** and **experimental** groups 10
     - Choose sampling method 7
     - Identify **treatments** 6
     - Identify null and alternative hypotheses 5
2. What are some examples of how an experiment can go wrong? Refer to specific steps from the list above.

The sampling method could be bad, you can make bad treatments, or the researcher could be expecting certain results so encourage those but disregard others.

4. How might an error affect the trustworthiness of a study? How much *should* an error affect the trustworthiness of a study?

An error might call into question the results based on that error's effect on the study. The error should affect the trustworthiness of a study because it is important to cocnduct studies correctly.

6. What might a scientist do to prevent such errors?

They will ensure that their study is as accurate to the real world as possible and that they follow their procedure that they set out to do.

8. What does it mean to **double blind** a study?

This means that both the experimentors and the participants don't know which group had which treatment.
